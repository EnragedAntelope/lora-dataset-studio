"""Subject isolation: cut the subject out onto a plain white background.

Two interchangeable backends:
- "builtin"  — SAM3 (facebook/sam3) in-process via transformers. No ComfyUI
  needed. The model is gated on Hugging Face: accept the license on the model
  page and authenticate (`hf auth login` or HF_TOKEN) before first use.
- "comfyui"  — the bundled SAM3 workflow templates, run on your ComfyUI.

Isolation matters twice: backgrounds/props can't leak into generations or the
final dataset, and edit models trained on clean renders (the Multiple-Angles
LoRA) behave far better on isolated subjects.
