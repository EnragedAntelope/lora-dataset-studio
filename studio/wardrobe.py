"""Random unisex outfits for the shot plan's `outfit` column.

Why this exists: a dataset built from source images that all show the same
clothes teaches the LoRA that the clothes are part of the character's identity.
Varying wardrobe across the shot set keeps the trigger token bound to the
character rather than to their jacket.

Everything here is deliberately gender-neutral so one pool serves any character
and the UI needs no masculine/feminine picker. Outfits are composed
(colour x garment) rather than hand-written in full, so ~40 vocabulary entries
yield thousands of combinations.
